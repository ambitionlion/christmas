1. In web development, the z-index property is used to control the stacking order of positioned elements on a web page. The z-index property takes a numerical value, and elements with higher z-index values will be stacked on top of elements with lower values. If two elements have the same z-index, the one that comes later in the HTML code will be stacked on top.
div {
  position: absolute;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}

#element1 {
  z-index: 50;
  background-color: red;
}

#element2 {
  z-index: 100;
  background-color: blue;
}
In this example, if element2 and element1 overlap on the page, element2 will appear on top of element1 because it has a higher z-index value (100 compared to 50).

2.The translate() function within the transform property is specifically used for moving an element from its current position, either horizontally or vertically or both.
In this example, the element with the class element will be shifted 4 pixels down from its original position. If the value were negative, like transform: translateY(-4px);, it would move the element 4 pixels up.

let now = new Date();: This line creates a new Date object named now, which represents the current date and time.

currentMonth = now.getMonth() + 1;: The getMonth() method of the Date object returns the zero-based month, where January is 0 and December is 11. By adding 1 to the result, you get the current month in a one-based index (January is 1, February is 2, and so on). The result is assigned to the variable currentMonth.

currentDay = now.getDate();: The getDate() method of the Date object returns the day of the month (1 to 31). The result is assigned to the variable currentDay

The 0 is being appended to hours to ensure that the displayed value always has two digits. This is a common practice in time-related displays where you want to ensure consistency in formatting. The goal is to make sure that single-digit hours are displayed with a leading zero.
